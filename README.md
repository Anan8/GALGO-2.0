# GALGO
Genetic Algorithm in C++ STL with lower and upper bounds for constrained problems optimization.

# Description
GALGO is a C++ template library, headers only, designed to solve a problem under constraints (or not) by maximizing or minimizing an objective function on given boundaries. It does not use any external C++ library, only the Standard Template Library. GALGO is fast and can use parallelism when required through OpenMP. GALGO is flexible and has been written in a way to allow the user to easily add new functionalities to the genetic algorithm. This library already contains some methods for selection, cross-over and mutation among the most widely used. The user can choose among these pre-existing methods to build a genetic algorithm or create new ones.
